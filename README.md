You can implement it yourself.

The file named kmeans.py includes function of clustering areas and function of clustering aspect ratios on boxes comig from training dataset.

The file named yolo.py is a yolo class which includes training yolo model, testing on images, and simply evaluating models(recall and average IoU)
